	Designers do more

than make shiny, pretty things. They shape how the world works by solving problems. And right now, the country has some problems. Regardless of whether you were protesting in the streets last weekend, you’d probably agree that people of all political stripes have receded into echo chambers. Discourse has devolved into arguments over facts and alternative facts. No one is sure how to move forward. Designers can help. There is a cadre of designers who devote themselves to politics and civic engagement. We spoke to some of them: researchers who study and clarify voting laws, designers who help communities navigate local regulations, and optimistic technologists. They offered five basic principles to help chart a more meaningful path forward:

<h3> REMOVE ROADBLOCKS </h3>

Participating in a democracy can feel daunting. Things like arcane voter registration laws, convoluted ballot measures, and the labyrinthine nature of government create confusion and little incentive to get involved. Designers call snags like this friction, and the best of them excel at removing them. When Google realized how many people were searching for voting information, its experience designers built tools to intuit their questions. Typing “where do I vo-” brought up tidily packaged answers presented in plain language. “Voter ID laws are so confusing and give you too much information,” says Lisa Tilson, a UX writer at Google. “A lot of my job is just pulling out information people do not need.” You don’t need Google’s pockets or human resources to make an impact. After the election, Pioneer Works, a multidisciplinary studio and incubator in Brooklyn, created a kiosk where people can literally make their voices heard. A visitor can enter his address in a computer, record a message, and the kiosk sends the voicemail to his state representative. By removing roadblocks, designers can make getting involved a little easier.

<h3> EXPECT TO DO NON-DESIGN WORK </h3>

The designer-client relationship revolves around an assignment, a Big Idea, and an unveiling. Political change doesn’t work that way. It happens slowly, and incrementally. “We get calls from people all the time saying, ‘We want to do something, we want to make an app,’” says Whitney Quesenbery, the co-founder of the Center for Civic Design. There’s nothing wrong with being ambitious, but an app isn’t always the answer. Designers may not regularly do clerical work, but elections offices and local non-profits need it. “They need proofreaders and volunteers and people to answer phone calls,” says Dana Chisnell of the Center for Civic Design. “Designers are often good at those things.” The work provides invaluable insights. Think of it as user research, says Christine Gaspar of the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP), a non-profit that uses design to increase civic engagement in underserved communities. Getting involved on a grassroots level can reveal problems that might not otherwise be obvious. “Show up and listen for while before you figure out how you can help them as a designer,” Gaspar says. “Over time you’ll realize they might have a design you can help with.”

<h3> ENGAGE WITH YOUR COMMUNITY </h3>

Every designer brings personal experiences and biases to a project, but effective designers put them aside and strive to understand the people they’re working for. “How do you as a designer show up in a way that’s being an ally and an accomplice first?” says Gaspar of CUP. A few years ago, Gaspar and her team were helping develop a pamphlet that would help public housing residents understand their rights. Her designer chose a particular shade of blue for the typography, which elicited a strong reaction from the community members. “They said, ‘You can’t use that color,'” Gaspar recalls. “That’s the color of the Housing Authority.” It was a simple mistake and easily rectified, because Gaspar’s team involved its constituents in the design process from the very beginning of the project. The experience led Gaspar to an important insight: Oftentimes the quickest path to a solution is to stop talking and start listening. “It’s about being respectful and showing up and creating spaces for people to give input that is meaningful,” she says. “It needs to be clear that we value their input. We’re not saying, ‘Here’s what we did, do you love it?’ We’re saying, ‘Here’s what we did, what’s wrong with it?'”

<h3> CREATE A SHARED LANGUAGE </h3>

Bureaucracies tend to move slowly and communicate poorly, something Sarah Brooks discovered when she became chief design officer at the US Department Veteran Affairs in 2014. President Obama wanted her team to make an agency with more than 365,000 employees into the government’s best customer service organization. She and her team worked with the US Digital Service to launch Vets.gov.1 They were also tasked with creating a consistent patient experience across 135 medical centers, community clinics, and hospice centers. Achieving this required bringing together a wide range of disparate goals, objectives, and vocabularies. “You need to be really good at finding a shared language,” Brooks says. Brooks began introducing VA staffers to new terminology like “journey map,” which describes a graphic that helps employees understand what veterans might be experiencing and how the agency can help. It took a little while for VA staff to catch on—“this is a service design 101 tool but it’s very new to VA,” she says—but eventually it became common parlance.
